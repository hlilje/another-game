Another time, another game.

This is a sort of work in progress, but due to the lack of support of the
Slick2D library and my lack of interest in Java programming, I might never
'properly' finish this. This was mostly an experiment to try out a
StateBasedGame, and that purpose was served. I've also learned that you
should never try to make a game and implement functions, before you
have an actual idea of where you are going with the game itself. My
initial idea was basically to make an RPG, but I quickly realised that it
would be too hard/time consuming. Therefore I present to you this, a game
with a random cyan dude running around a room, collecting squares and
avoiding evil and good copies of himself. Or something.
GLHF!
